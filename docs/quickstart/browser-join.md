# ✨[Preview]✨ Joining a Live Share session from the browser

All Live Share collaboration sessions now have the ability to be joined from the browser. This means that a guest to your session no longer needs to install VS Code or Visual Studio to join your session. This is especially helpful for all those instances when you want someone to get into your session quickly, or for students who often don't have the desktop clients installed.


# How to join a Live Share session from the browser 

### 1. Host: starts session 
To begin, the host should go to either Visual Studio or VS Code to start a collaboration session. When the host shares a folder or project.

### 2. Guest: uses shared link to join from browser 
Live Share will generate a join link that can be shared with the guest. The guest can now use this link to be navigated to a web page, which now gives them an option to continue to the browser.

### 3. Guest: Enjoys full fidelity collaboration experience from browser 
Once the guest has joined the session, they can carry on just like they would if they were collaborating from the desktop clients.

# Frequently asked questions 

##### 1. Is there an environment running in the background, that is hosting my session in the browser?
When you join a Live Share session from the browser, there is no new environment spun up. It is a serverless service. 
##### 2. Do I have to pay for the service of joining from the browser?
Joining from the browser is free, much like all of Live Share.

##### 3. How is this different from Visual Studio Online?
When you join from the browser, you only access the VS Code client from the browser during the session. Once the session ends, all the files and folders along with editor capabilities will close. To use an editor in the browser, backed with your own environment to edit your own files, you must use [Visual Studio Online.](aka.ms/vso)

##### 4. Does this work for all browsers?
Yes. This works on all browsers. 
##### 5. Is there a VS client that I can use in the browser?
We do not have this available yet.
